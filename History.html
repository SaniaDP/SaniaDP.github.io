   <p> My history artifact is my timeline project. For my timeline project, I was assigned the Battle of Yorktown and the First Continental Congress. In the Battle or Yorktown I discribed how the Americans won the Revolution and the struggles they faced. In the First Continental Congress, I wrote about why it was formed, and the purpose it served. I think I tried hard on this project. I put in a lot of effort.</p>
